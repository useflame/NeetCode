# Encode and Decode Strings

## Problem
Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
- Input: `["neet","code","love","you"]`
- Output: `["neet","code","love","you"]`

**Example 2:**
- Input: `["we","say",":","yes"]`
- Output: `["we","say",":","yes"]`

## Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the total number of characters
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the encoded string
