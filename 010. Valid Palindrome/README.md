# Valid Palindrome

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, otherwise return false.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. It is also case-insensitive and ignores all non-alphanumeric characters.

Note: Alphanumeric characters consist of letters (A-Z, a-z) and numbers (0-9).

## Example 1:
Input: s = "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"
Output: true
Explanation: After considering only alphanumerical characters we have "wasitacaroracatisaw", which is a palindrome.

## Example 2:
Input: s = "tab a cat"
Output: false
Explanation: "tabacat" is not a palindrome.

## Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 1000
- s is made up of only printable ASCII characters.

## Approach:
Use two pointers (start and end) to compare characters from both ends. Skip non-alphanumeric characters and compare case-insensitively.
