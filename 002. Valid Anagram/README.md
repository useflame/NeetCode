# Valid Anagram

## Problem
Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

## Examples
- Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"
- Output: true

- Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"
- Output: false

## Recommended Time & Space Complexity
You should aim for a solution with O(n + m) time and O(1) space, where n is the length of the string s and m is the length of the string t.

## Constraints
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
